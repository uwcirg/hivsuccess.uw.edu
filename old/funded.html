							<p>For our 2021 pilot funding call HARC has $100,000 available to fund 2-4 pilot projects ($25,000-$50,000 each) focusing the application of geroscience to better understand aging in people living with HIV (PLWH). These are intended to be one-year pilot grants. Pilot applications are welcome from any CFAR, NSC, MBI, or OAIC faculty investigator at any rank with a strong preference for early stage investigators (post-doctoral fellows are NOT eligible unless will be a faculty member on July 1 2021). Ideal candidates plan to use their study to leverage funding for an NIH early investigator award. All applicants must have a collaborator or mentor from one of the participating centers with complementary experience (i.e., CFAR investigators must be paired with an investigator from NSC, MBI or OAIC, and vice versa). We are particularly interested in studies that: (a) utilize OAIC, MBI, NSC, CFAR or CNICS specimens and/or databases; (b) receive support from their local OAIC, MBI, NSC, or CFAR in the form of matched funding or covered indirect costs; and (c) include more established aging investigators that do not have prior HIV funding, but would like to expand into HIV-Aging research. </p>

							<h2 id="title-review-criteria-for-full-proposals">Review Criteria for Full Proposals</h2>
							<p>Reviewers will provide a written critique based on the evaluation criteria listed below, goals of this R33, and clarity of how funding will lead to subsequent grant applications and research productivity to yield an overall impact score.</p>
							<p>After the review meeting, written critiques will be provided to the applicants regardless of success. </p>
							<p>The evaluation criteria include:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>Significance – What will be the potential effect of these studies on the concepts or methods that drive the field of research? Does the study address an important problem consistent with the objective to advance our understanding of HIV in the aging population? If the aims are achieved, how will scientific knowledge be advanced?</li>
							<li>Investigator – Are the PI, mentor(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? Do the PI and other investigators have appropriate experience and training? If the project is collaborative, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise, and are there both OAIC and CFAR researchers involved?</li>
							<li>Approach – Are the conceptual framework, design, methods, and statistical analysis plan adequately developed, well integrated and appropriate to the aims of the project? Does the applicant acknowledge potential problem areas and consider alternatives? Does the study design account appropriately for differences by sex or gender, if applicable?</li>
							<li>Innovation – Does the project employ novel concepts, approaches, or methods?  Are the aims original and innovative? Does the project challenge existing paradigms or develop new methodologies or technologies?</li>
							<li>Environment – Do the proposed methods take advantage of the unique environment and unique populations where appropriate? Are useful collaborative arrangements between resources in the institution(s) utilized where appropriate and described adequately?</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>Review Committee:</strong>
							Applications will be reviewed by the Application Research Committee, consisting of CFAR and OAIC/MBI/NSC Investigators, with procedures analogous to an NIH Study Section. </p>
							<p>Each application will have a primary, secondary, and biostatistical reviewer (where appropriate). </p>
							<p>The reviewers will be asked to summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal based on all of the above criteria.  </p>
							<p>Each project is scored according to the NIH scoring system using overall impact as the metric for success. </p>

							<p>All questions regarding the awarding of funding should be directed to the contact listed in the notice of award. </p>
							<p>Prior to the awarding of funding, the following information should be provided, if applicable: </p>
							<ul>
							<li>Animal Care and Institutional Review Board approvals, if applicable, must be obtained prior to receipt of an award, </li>
							<li>these are not required to submit an application. </li>
							<li>Prior to funding, a copy of all Institutional Biohazard, Animal Care and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals must be forwarded to the post-award administrator.</li>
							<li>Prior to receipt of an award involving human subjects, IRB approval from all participating sites and human subjects training certification for all key personnel will be required. </li>

							<h2 id="acknowledging-funding">Acknowledging Funding</h2>
							<p>This research was supported by funding from the NIA through the AIDS and Aging Research Platform (award # R33AG067069)</p>
							<h2 id="presenting-research-findings">Presenting Research Findings</h2>
							<p>All pilot awardees will be expected to give a presentation of their findings from this pilot study to a recommended Aging Conference (e.g., OAIC annual meeting, NSC annual meeting) if the lead investigator is from an HIV research background or a recommended HIV Conference (.g., CFAR annual conference, CROI, Keystone Meeting on HIV and Aging) if the lead investigator is from an aging research background.</p>
							<h2 id="reporting-related-outputs">Reporting Related Outputs</h2>
							<p>Future funding for pilot grants and other HIV-Aging infrastructure is dependent on success of the grant that supports these pilot awards. It is well recognized that outputs from studies continued to be produced for five or more years following completion of a study. Therefore you will be expected to report any outputs from funding for at least 5 years following receipt of funding. Outputs may include, but are not limited to:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>Using methods developed in this study (even in future studies) – all funding sources should be acknowledged</li>
							<li>Use of data collected in this study (even in future studies)</li>
							<li>Use of specimens collected in this study (even in future studies)</li>
							<li>Use of reagents developed in this study (even in future studies)</li>
							</ul>
