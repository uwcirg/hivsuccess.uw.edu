							<h1 id="">Cohorts</h1>
							<p>NIDA supports nine dynamic cohorts that examine the most important issues with respect to substance use and HIV risk and acquisition for those who do not have HIV and engagement in care, prevention of on-ward transmission and health outcomes among people with HIV (PWH). Each cohort has a unique focus and population, which helps to develop inclusive knowledge of risk and prevention among people who use substances who are also at risk for or living with HIV.</p>

							<p>The AIDS Care Cohort to Evaluate Exposure to Survival Services (ACCESS) focuses on people with HIV (PWH) who also use illicit drugs in Vancouver, BC, Canada and the surrounding area. The focus of research has been understanding how social, economic and individual factors, as well as local policy, impacts the health and well-being of PWH who also use illicit drugs.</p> 
							<p>Recent studies have highlighted the impact of longitudinal non-injection crack cocaine use on higher HIV viral loads, demonstrated the minimum antiretroviral adherence required for HIV viral suppression among PWH who used illicit drugs and the impact of opioid agonist treatment on success in completing HIV care cascade progression. These studies can support realistic strategies to help PWH who also use illicit drugs in achieving the best HIV-related outcomes possible.</p>

							<h2 id="ALIVE"><br>ALIVE</h2>
							<p>The AIDS Linked to the IntraVenous Experience (ALIVE) Study is the longest running NIDA cohort. ALIVE began in 1988 in order to understand the incidence and natural history of HIV infection among people who inject drugs (PWID). Now encompassing two cohorts ALIVE I, which most includes people with HIV (PWH) who have a history of substance use, and ALIVE II which includes people with a history of substance use who do not have HIV, ALIVE examines current issues that people who use drugs (PWUD) face, including access to care, risks and outcomes.</p>
							<p>Recent work has focused on longitudinal analyses demonstrating the value of following populations of people who inject drugs (PWID) over decades to understand evolving needs and outcomes.  Of note, ALIVE demonstrated the penetration and impact of directly acting antivirals (DAAs) for HCV treatment, including a reduction in liver cirrhosis over time, and factors influencing DAA uptake both generally and during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting subpopulations that could use greater support for DAA uptake.  Longitudinal analyses also highlighted a dramatic increase in incidence of fatal and non-fatal overdose from 2014-2019, consistent with the rise of synthetic opioid use. Overall, looking at mortality among PWID since 1988, ALIVE demonstrated that about 1/3 were from HIV and other infections, 1/3 were from chronic diseases and ¼ were from drug-related deaths; highlighting the need for a multipronged approach to health among PWID.</p>

							<h2 id="Heart"><br>Heart</h2>
							<p>Uniquely developed to examine the impact of HIV on coronary artery disease (CAD), including morphological changes, and the additional burden or cocaine use, the Heart study, includes aging participants with and without HIV who have never used cocaine and those who have a history of cocaine use in each group.  Extension of research activities include assessing the impact of HIV and/or cocaine use on cognitive function and brain morphology. Morphological characteristics of the cardiovascular and neurologic systems are mapped using MRI combined with rich clinical, cognitive assessment and behavioral data.</p>
							<p>Recent publications have demonstrated that cocaine use in combination with HIV-infection appears to have a synergistic effect on CAD as compared to HIV infection alone. Early work on the impact of HIV and cocaine on neurocognitive impairment (NCI) has also revealed potential lower cognitive performance in people with HIV (PWH) with a history of cocaine use compared to those without, especially among women.</p>

							<h2 id="HYM">HYM + TRUTH</h2>
							<p>Starting with the Healthy Young Men’s Study (HYM) in 2015 and combining the Transgender Youth of Color Study (TRUTH) in 2018, the HYM + TRUTH cohort uniquely focuses on the mental health, stigma and social-structural factors and their impact on HIV and substance use prevention and care among vulnerable youth who at risk of multiple inequities.  Detailed data collection on mental health and psychological experiences of participants, combined with detailed behavioral and laboratory data, along with banked biospecimens, positions HYM+TRUTH as a ledging cohort for developing a unique understanding of the multidimensional challenges that youth of color who identify as gay, bisexual, transgender or non-binary face, as well as, insight into interventions to support health and well-being of this population.</p>
							<p>Recent work has highlighted the profound impact of stigma, racism and life stressors on the mental health of young adults experiencing multiple stigmata. HYM +TRUTH investigators have also examined the impact of family dynamics, specifically greater bonding with either a male or female parent reduced PrEP stigma among Black and Latino men who have sex with men (MSM).</p>

							<h2 id="JHHCC"><br>JHHCC</h2>
							<p>The Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort (JHHCC) focuses on people with HIV (PWH) who are in care in the Baltimore area taking advantage of the opportunity to collect both information from the clinical care record, as well as observe the natural history of clinical care engagement, referral and treatment and the impact of substance use behaviors one these. In addition to clinical data, JHHCC collects robust patient reported outcomes and measures (PROs) for important measures such as substance use and dependence, mental health, economic and housing conditions, food insecurity, incarceration, and quality of life among others. Well curated information, such as adjudicated outcomes for cardiovascular events, and geocoding to incorporate determinants of health based on neighborhood, such as concentration of poverty or crime, transportation, availability of food, etc. enable researchers to examine syndemics and the dynamics of different factors in conjunction with substance use that may impact the health and well-being of PWH over decades. Additionally, JHHCC contributes data to a number of data collaboratives to support research that can lead to effective changes in care, policy and interventions to support the health and well-being of PWH.</p>
							<p>Recent studies have shown that history of substance use disorders were associated, regardless of current substance use, was associated with having unsuppressed HIV viral loads, furthermore treatment with Buprenorphine for substance use resulted in a greater likelihood of being virally suppressed. Additionally, the JHHCC team have used cohort data to develop a Bayesian predictive algorithm using current PROs to predict future mental health and substance use events. As the JHHCC is a clinical cohort, the team was also able to evaluate strategies to improve primary HIV care visits during the COVID pandemic, finding that use of telehealth increased visits for younger people, Black people, PWH who had detectable HIV viremia and women above pre-pandemic rates, suggesting the need for a range of visit options to create equity in care access.</p>

							<h2 id="MASH"><br>MASH</h2>
							<p>The Miami Adult Studies on HIV (MASH) cohort focuses on understanding the impact of cocaine use on people with HIV (PWH) and people with HIV and HCV coinfection, including lon-term chronic impact on cognitive and liver function among other comorbidities, such as diabetes. Laboratory analyses are combined with detailed behavioral and diet data, cognitive assessments, and clinical information on PWH who do and do not use illicit substances to support multiple different studies teasing apart the impact of substance use and HIV on important clinical outcomes.  The MASH cohort remarkably includes a large proportion of women living with HIV who identify as Hispanic women, which is an understudied subgroup of people with HIV (PWH). Similarly, the impact of both substance use and long-term HIV infection and the combination of the two is understudied in women, making MASH an important cohort for understanding the health of women at the intersection of substance use and HIV.</p>
							<p>Recent studies have examined the impact of cocaine use on gut permeability, microbiome and microbial translocation, revealing that cocaine may increase inflammation and pathogenic states in the instestines of PWH. Additional recent studies have shown and asssociations between heroin and fentanyl use and higher cognitive impairment, as well as higher depression and liver fibrosis.</p>

							<p>The MSM and Substances Cohort at UCLA Linking Infections Noting Effects (MASCULINE or the “mSTUDY”) focuses on the effects of substance use on sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV risk and acquisition, biological impact of substance use on mucosa and the effect of substance use on the inflammatory response in people with HIV (PWH). Due to lower representation in previous studies, yet higher risk of HIV infection, the mSTUDY has focused on recruiting Black and Latino identified men who have sex with men (MSM). mSTUDY combines clinical wellness examinations with detailed behavioral questionnaires to understand factors that impact the health and risk for HIV among MSM of color.</p>
							<p>Recent work focusing on rectal STIs have revealed differing inflammatory markers in rectal mucosa of MSM with STI by methaphemaine (MA) use and that reporting MA use was associated with reporting more  receptive anal intercourse (RAI) partners and more RAI partners was associated with increased risk of rectal STI. An additional studies of MA use among MSM in the mSTUDY also revealed MA use was higher among those who were diagnosed with a rectal STI than those who were not and that stimulant use during sexual activity was associated with transactional sex.</p>

							<p>Focused on ending the HIV epidemic, RADAR incorporates biological, dyadic and network level information to develop a greater understanding of sexually transmitted infections (STI), substance use and romantic partnerships and their contribution to HIV transmission. Focused young men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women in Chicago, one of the urban epicenters of the US HIV epidemic, RADAR seeks to develop a robust epidemiological understanding of HIV transmission in order to support preventive measure to end the HIV epidemic.  This work is supported by detailed measures on individual behavioral, partnership and network level data from questionnaires, combined with biological assessments, allowing for robust longitudinal assessments of pre-, acute, and post- HIV infection analyses.</p>
							<p>Recent RADAR studies focusing on use of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for reducing HIV transmission, have demonstrated associations between having health insurance, a partner with HIV, or being single or in an open relationship, as compared to a monogamous relationship, and PrEP re-initiation and that young people described using multiple strategies and maintaining a  positive outlook to respond to barriers to PrEP use.   Furthermore, agent based models conducted within the team have suggested that that both optimal levels of antiretroviral adherence and PrEP adherence would be required to achieve a 90% reduction in HIV transmission by 2023.   In addition to scientific finding RADAR investigators have recently developed new tools for support easy data collection on social and contact networks and reducing participant burden on microaggression experiences.</p>

							<p>The Vancouver Drug Use Study (V-DUS) brings together the Vancouver Injections Drug Users Study (VIDUS), started in 1996, and the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), started in 2005, cohorts to dynamically observe evolving patterns of substance use from initiation and early use of any substance in ARYS to injections use of substances in VIDUS and how these impact participants risk for acquiring HIV and other health-related issues. Research within V-DUS not only focuses on individual risk factor epidemiology around substance use and HIV, but dynamically examines the impact of local policies and interventions on individual behaviors, local substance circulation and risk for HIV acquisition and other health concerns.</p> 
							<p>Recent studies have examined the impact of cannabis use on methadone maintenance therapy (MMT), specifically demonstrating the potential use of cannabis to avoid opioid use while on lower doses of MMT, however, lower MMT does were longitudinally found to result in MMT discontinuation, which was influenced by structural factors such as homelessness and incarceration. They also examined cannabis use as a harm reduction strategy, finding that daily methamphetamine use, barriers to accessing substance use treatment, and being enrolled in non-opioid substance use treatment programs was associated with using cannabis for harm reduction. Other recent studies have demonstrated that needle/syringe exchange and opioid agonist therapy lead to significant reductions in seroconversion for HIV and HCV across multiple cohorts and that engagement substance use treatment was negatively associated with re-incarceration, while being unhoused was positively associated. These studies demonstrate a breadth of findings that could support public policy and intervention programs to help end the HIV epidemic.</p>
