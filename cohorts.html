							<p>NIDA supports nine dynamic cohorts that examine the most important issues with respect to substance use and HIV risk and acquisition for those who do not have HIV and engagement in care, prevention of on-ward transmission and health outcomes among people with HIV (PWH). Each cohort has a unique focus and population, which helps to develop inclusive knowledge of risk and prevention among people who use substances who are also at risk for or living with HIV.</p>

							<p>The AIDS Care Cohort to Evaluate Exposure to Survival Services (ACCESS) focuses on people with HIV (PWH) who also use illicit drugs in Vancouver, BC, Canada and the surrounding area. The focus of research has been understanding how social, economic and individual factors, as well as local policy, impacts the health and well-being of PWH who also use illicit drugs.</p> 
							<p>Recent studies have highlighted the impact of longitudinal non-injection crack cocaine use on higher HIV viral loads, demonstrated the minimum antiretroviral adherence required for HIV viral suppression among PWH who used illicit drugs and the impact of opioid agonist treatment on success in completing HIV care cascade progression. These studies can support realistic strategies to help PWH who also use illicit drugs in achieving the best HIV-related outcomes possible.</p>

							<h2 id="ALIVE"><br>ALIVE</h2>
							<p>The AIDS Linked to the IntraVenous Experience (ALIVE) Study is the longest running NIDA cohort. ALIVE began in 1988 in order to understand the incidence and natural history of HIV infection among people who inject drugs (PWID). Now encompassing two cohorts ALIVE I, which includes people with HIV (PWH) who have a history of substance use, and ALIVE II which includes people with a history of substance use who do not have HIV, ALIVE examines current issues that people who use drugs (PWUD) face, including access to care, risks and outcomes.</p>
							<p>Recent work has focused on longitudinal analyses demonstrating the value of following populations of people who inject drugs (PWID) over decades to understand evolving needs and outcomes.  Of note, ALIVE demonstrated the penetration and impact of directly acting antivirals (DAAs) for HCV treatment, including a reduction in liver cirrhosis over time, and factors influencing DAA uptake both generally and during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting subpopulations that could use greater support for DAA uptake.  Longitudinal analyses also highlighted a dramatic increase in incidence of fatal and non-fatal overdose from 2014-2019, consistent with the rise of synthetic opioid use. Overall, looking at mortality among PWID since 1988, ALIVE demonstrated that about 1/3 were from HIV and other infections, 1/3 were from chronic diseases and ¼ were from drug-related deaths; highlighting the need for a multipronged approach to health among PWID.</p>

							<h2 id="Heart"><br>Heart</h2>
							<p>Uniquely developed to examine the impact of HIV on coronary artery disease (CAD), including morphological changes, and the additional burden or cocaine use, the Heart study, includes aging participants with and without HIV who have never used cocaine and those who have a history of cocaine use in each group.  Extension of research activities include assessing the impact of HIV and/or cocaine use on cognitive function and brain morphology. Morphological characteristics of the cardiovascular and neurologic systems are mapped using MRI combined with rich clinical, cognitive assessment and behavioral data.</p>
							<p>Recent publications have demonstrated that cocaine use in combination with HIV-infection appears to have a synergistic effect on CAD as compared to HIV infection alone. Early work on the impact of HIV and cocaine on neurocognitive impairment (NCI) has also revealed potential lower cognitive performance in people with HIV (PWH) with a history of cocaine use compared to those without, especially among women.</p>

							<h2 id="HYM">HYM + TRUTH</h2>
							<p>Starting  in 2015 the HYM + TRUTH cohort uniquely focuses on the mental health, stigma and social-structural factors and their impact on HIV and substance use prevention and care among vulnerable youth who are at risk of multiple inequities.  Detailed data collection on mental health and psychological experiences of participants, combined with detailed behavioral and laboratory data, along with banked biospecimens, positions HYM + TRUTH as a leading cohort for developing a unique understanding of the multidimensional challenges that youth of color  face, as well as, insight into interventions to support health and well-being of this population.</p>
							<p>Recent work has highlighted the profound impact of stigma, racism and life stressors on the mental health of young adults experiencing multiple stigmata, understanding the experience of sero-converters participation in the prevention and treatment HIV cascade, and the relation between sexual racism and substance use. HYM + TRUTH investigators have also examined the impact of family dynamics, specifically greater bonding with either a male or female parent reduced PrEP stigma among Black and Latino men who have sex with men (MSM).</p>

							<h2 id="JHHCC"><br>JHHCC</h2>
							<p>The Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort (JHHCC) focuses on people with HIV (PWH) who are in care in Baltimore City (an EHE target jurisdiction) and the surrounding area. The JHHCC is majority African-American, has over one-third women and has a high proportion of economically disadvantaged PWH, all key populations of the EHE.    As a cohort integrated into clinical care, the JHHCC takes advantage of the opportunity to collect information from the clinical care record to observe the natural history of care engagement, referral, treatment, clinical progression, occurrence of co-morbid disease, and the impact of substance use behaviors on these measures. In addition to clinical data, JHHCC collects robust patient reported outcomes (PROs) and measures substance use and dependence, mental health, economic and housing conditions, food insecurity, incarceration, and quality of life among others. Well-curated information, such as adjudicated outcomes for cardiovascular events, and geocoding to incorporate determinants of health based on neighborhood characteristics, such as the concentration of poverty or crime, transportation, availability of food, etc. enable researchers to examine syndemics and the dynamics of different factors in conjunction with substance use that may impact the health and well-being of PWH.  Additionally, JHHCC contributes data to a number of data collaboratives and agencies including the state health department, HRSA (Ryan White Program) and the CDC that can lead to effective changes in care, policy and interventions to support the health and well-being of PWH. </p>
							<p>Recent studies have shown that a history of substance use disorders, regardless of current substance use, was associated with having unsuppressed HIV viral load.  Furthermore, treatment with buprenorphine for substance use resulted in a greater likelihood of being virally suppressed. Additionally, the JHHCC team has used cohort data to develop a Bayesian predictive algorithm using current PROs to predict future mental health and substance use events. As the JHHCC is a clinical cohort, the team was also able to evaluate strategies to improve primary HIV care visits during the COVID pandemic, finding that use of telehealth increased visits for younger people, Black people, PWH who had detectable HIV viremia and women above pre-pandemic rates, suggesting the need for a range of visit options to create equity in care access.</p>

							<h2 id="MASH"><br>MASH</h2>
							<p>The Miami Adult Studies on HIV (MASH) cohort focuses on understanding the impact of cocaine use on people with HIV (PWH) and people with HIV and HCV coinfection, including long-term chronic impact on cognitive and liver function among other comorbidities, such as diabetes. Laboratory analyses are combined with detailed behavioral and diet data, cognitive assessments, and clinical information on PWH who do and do not use illicit substances to support multiple different studies teasing apart the impact of substance use and HIV on important clinical outcomes.  The MASH cohort remarkably includes a large proportion of women living with HIV who identify as Hispanic women, which is an understudied subgroup of people with HIV (PWH). Similarly, the impact of both substance use and long-term HIV infection and the combination of the two is understudied in women, making MASH an important cohort for understanding the health of women at the intersection of substance use and HIV.</p>
							<p>Recent studies have examined the impact of cocaine use on gut permeability, microbiome and microbial translocation, revealing that cocaine may increase inflammation and pathogenic states in the instestines of PWH. Additional recent studies have shown an association between heroin and fentanyl use and higher cognitive impairment, as well as higher depression and liver fibrosis.</p>

							<p>The MSM and Substances Cohort at UCLA Linking Infections Noting Effects (MASCULINE or the “mSTUDY”) focuses on the effects of substance use on sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV risk and acquisition, biological impact of substance use on mucosa and the effect of substance use on the inflammatory response in people with HIV (PWH). Due to lower representation in previous studies, yet higher risk of HIV infection, the mSTUDY has focused on recruiting Black and Latino identified men who have sex with men (MSM). mSTUDY combines clinical wellness examinations with detailed behavioral questionnaires to understand factors that impact the health and risk for HIV among MSM of color.</p>
							<p>Recent work focusing on rectal STIs have revealed differing inflammatory markers in rectal mucosa of MSM with STI by methaphemaine (MA) use and that reporting MA use was associated with reporting more  receptive anal intercourse (RAI) partners and more RAI partners was associated with increased risk of rectal STI. An additional studies of MA use among MSM in the mSTUDY also revealed MA use was higher among those who were diagnosed with a rectal STI than those who were not and that stimulant use during sexual activity was associated with transactional sex.</p>

							<p>Focusing on ending the HIV epidemic, RADAR takes a multilevel perspective that incorporates biological, dyadic, network, and developmental information to gain a greater understanding of sexually transmitted infections (STI), substance use, and romantic partnerships and their contribution to HIV transmission. Focused young men who have sex with men (MSM) in Chicago, one of the urban epicenters of the US HIV epidemic, RADAR seeks to develop a robust epidemiological understanding of HIV transmission in order to inform implementation strategies to end HIV transmission.  This work is supported by detailed measures on individual behavioral, partnership and network level data from questionnaires, combined with biological assessments, allowing for robust longitudinal assessments of pre-, acute, and post- HIV infection analyses.  The study is unique in that racially diverse MSM and transgender women are enrolled between the ages of 16-20 and followed longitudinally. </p>
							<p>Recent RADAR studies focusing on use of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for reducing HIV transmission, have demonstrated associations between having health insurance, a partner with HIV, or being single or in an open relationship, as compared to a monogamous relationship, and PrEP re-initiation and that young people described using multiple strategies and maintaining a positive outlook to respond to barriers to PrEP use. Furthermore, agent based models using RADAR data have suggested optimal levels of antiretroviral adherence and PrEP adherence required to achieve a 90% reduction in HIV transmission by 2023. In addition to scientific finding, RADAR investigators have recently developed new tools to support easy data collection on social and contact networks and validated several unique measures (e.g., microaggressions).</p>

							<p>The Vancouver Drug Use Study (V-DUS) brings together the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS), started in 1996, and the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), started in 2005, cohorts to dynamically observe evolving patterns of substance use from initiation and early use of any substance in ARYS to injection use of substances in VIDUS and how these impact participants risk for acquiring HIV and other health-related issues. Research within V-DUS not only focuses on individual risk factor epidemiology around substance use and HIV, but dynamically examines the impact of local policies and interventions on individual behaviors, local substance circulation and risk for HIV acquisition and other health concerns.</p> 
							<p>V-DUS has been serving as a key epidemiological data source for a range of public health policies and programs in the ongoing toxic drug/overdose crisis across Canada and the US as well as to help end the HIV epidemic in this region. Immediately after the Provincial Health Officer in British Columbia declared a public health emergency due to the rising unregulated drug toxicity/overdose deaths in April 2016, V-DUS adopted urine drug screens to the data collection procedures, resulting in a series of peer-reviewed publications characterizing the emergent exposure to fentanyl in the unregulated drug supply among people who use drugs in Vancouver and providing recommendations for related health education and interventions.</p>
							<p>Recent studies from VIDUS have demonstrated health benefits associated with the expansion of supervised consumption sites in Vancouver since 2016, and collaborated on an international research project that estimated causal effects of comprehensive needle and syringe program and opioid agonist therapy (OAT) on the reduction of HIV and HCV incidence. While these studies provide important scientific evidence to support the adaptation of these interventions internationally, other recent studies have shown the increasing use of crystal methamphetamine and its negative impacts on OAT-related outcomes, indicating the urgent need to address polysubstance use in OAT and increase evidence-based treatment and care options for stimulant use. Further, recent studies from ARYS have also exhibited concerning trends related to OAT among young people who use opioids, including extremely low interest in buprenorphine-naloxone and high discontinuation rates of methadone maintenance treatment, and highlighted the importance of improving addiction treatments for young people and ensuring robust HIV prevention interventions for those who continue regular unregulated opioid use. In summary, V-DUS studies demonstrate a breadth of findings that could support public policy and intervention programs to help address both the HIV epidemic and toxic drug crisis.</p>
