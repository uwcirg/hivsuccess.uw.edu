							<h1 id="hiv-aging-pilot-program"><img src="images/HIV Success Icon + Ribbon.png" style="height: 0.7em;"> HIV SUCCESS Pilot Program</h1>
							<p>For our 2024 HIV SUCCESS funding call we will support 2 pilot projects up to $25,000 for early-stage investigators, investigators new to HIV and substance use research or investigators from diverse backgrounds. </p>
							<p>Eligible projects should focus on important, new research utilizing cross-cohort data that will lead to future grant applications and discovery to support the heath and well-being of people who use drugs (PWUD) who are at risk for or living with HIV.</p>
							<p>RFA release anticipated in late summer or early Fall 2024. Details will be provided here.</p>
						
							<!--<p>For our 2023 pilot funding call HARC will fund 2-4 pilot projects, at $40,000 each, focusing the application of geroscience to better understand aging in people living with HIV (PLWH). These are intended to be one-year pilot grants. Pilot applications are welcome from (a) faculty investigators who have not yet had an R01 or other substantial NIH funding (i.e., new investigators by NIH definitions) or (b) Geroscience faculty investigators at any rank who are new to HIV research. Post-doctoral fellows are NOT eligible unless they will be a faculty member on or before July 1 2023. Ideal candidates plan to use their study to leverage funding for an NIH new investigator award. All applicants must have a collaborator or mentor from one of the participating centers (NSC, MBI, OAIC, or CFAR), and all applications must include at least one investigator from both HIV and Geroscience. We are particularly interested in studies that: (a) utilize OAIC, MBI, NSC, CFAR or CNICS specimens and/or databases; (b) receive support from their local OAIC, MBI, NSC, or CFAR in the form of matched funding, covered indirect costs, or core facility support; and (c) include more established aging investigators that do not have prior HIV funding, but would like to expand into HIV-Aging research. </p>

								<li>Awardees who have support from K awards should discuss eligibility issues with their program officers and with institutional officials as eligibility may vary by NIH sponsor for the K award and institutional policies.  The staff of this mechanism is not able to determine eligibility for K awardees.</li>
								<li>All costs must conform to the NIH Grants Policy Statement (GPS) and applicable U.S. Office of Management and Budget OMB circulars for necessity and reasonability, allocability, conformance and consistency, as well as allowability.

							<h2 id="presenting-research-findings">Presenting Research Findings</h2>
							<p>All pilot awardees will be expected to give a presentation of their findings from this pilot study to a recommended Aging Conference (e.g., OAIC annual meeting, NSC annual meeting) if the lead investigator is from an HIV research background or a recommended HIV Conference (.g., CFAR annual conference, CROI, Keystone Meeting on HIV and Aging) if the lead investigator is from an aging research background.</p>
							<h2 id="reporting-related-outputs">Reporting Related Outputs</h2>
							<p>Future funding for pilot grants and other HIV-Aging infrastructure is dependent on success of the grant that supports these pilot awards. It is well recognized that outputs from studies continued to be produced for five or more years following completion of a study. Therefore you will be expected to report any outputs from funding for at least 5 years following receipt of funding. Outputs may include, but are not limited to:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>Using methods developed in this study (even in future studies) – all funding sources should be acknowledged</li>
							<li>Use of data collected in this study (even in future studies)</li>
							<li>Use of specimens collected in this study (even in future studies)</li>
							<li>Use of reagents developed in this study (even in future studies)</li>
